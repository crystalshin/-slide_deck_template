# About FordGoBike Data
Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California operated by Motivate, in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. In this project, I will perform an exploatory analysis on data provided by Ford Go Bike, a bike-share system provider taken in from 2018 June to 2019 June.

# Summary of Findings
June is the most popular month and December is the least demanded month due to the weather conditions. Thursday is the most demanded day of the week due to the daily commute and the weekend is the least demanded, especially for Sunday. The trip duration is less than 1800 seconds. In additions, 6 to 15 minutes are the most common duration. It is due to the extra $3 charges for additional 15 minutes, and also most of communte times takes only 5-15 minutes. 89% are subscribers while 11 % are customers, which means the most of GoBike users are subscribers. Both for subscribers and customers, there are more female users than male. The ratio for subscribers are three times greater between the different gender while it is twice greater for customers. Subscriber use the system mostly within a week while customer use it mostly on the weekend. Subscriber mostly use 8-9am and 17-18pm while customer suse the bike share system througout the day. There are some missing datas between 2018.07 and 2018.10, and also between 2019.04 and 2019.05. The daily trend of bike rides shows the increasing numbers of bike rides in 2019 March and decreasing numbers in 2018 December and 2019 January.
